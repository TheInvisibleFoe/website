Hello people. I am Sabarno Saha, a physics major at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata.I kinda also somewhat like math. 

I made this website because I wanted a website. After doing that, the website lay dormant for a year because I was too lazy to even write anything for it.So now in an effort to actually do something about this website, I've been thinking about posting blogs about 
random stuff I find cool. Also, I need to improve my writing skills because it is currently abysmal and resembles how Luke Dunphy might talk after a concussion.  I might also write some 
album reviews in a different page, but I am lazy. Finally, welcome to the Octopus Garden and it's horrendously written blogs.
This is a list of the stuff I have written till now.(I will hyperlink them later).
- Systems attaining Equilibrium.
