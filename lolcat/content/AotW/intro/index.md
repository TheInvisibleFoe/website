I listen to music now and then and then some more. Now and then I get stuck into a vicious listening cycle, where I listen to same songs over and over again. In an attempt to increase and diversify my music tastes, I have been listening to a new album every week and I’ll try to jot down my feelings here.

Pop and rock have always been my go-to genres, mostly leaning towards rock. Recently, I have been exploring hindi rock. Some of my favourite bands playing hindi rock are listed in the [About me](https://theinvisiblefoe.github.io/about/) section.

A lot of Indian bands playing rock music, tend to have metal undertones, which I do not particularly like. The bands that do make rock music tend to do it quite well. A lot of indian rock bands are quite underappreciated. I plan on writing reviews of albums I listen to during a particular time period, doesn’t have to be a week. AoTW(Album of the Week) just sounds a lot catchier than AoaPTP(Album of a particular time period), hence, the name.
