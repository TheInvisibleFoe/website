# Unimportant Notes

Aside from the lecture notes, there are some extra notes that might prove beneficial to the chosen few.


> [!MEMO]+ LaTeX Workshop Handout.
> Some of my friends and I conducted a small workshop for our Coding and Designing Club, [Slashdot](https://slashdot-iiserk.github.io/) on using LaTeX for academic purposes. We circulated a Handout, which is here.
> 1. [Handout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheInvisibleFoe/IISER_notes/main/LaTeX%20Workshop%20Handout/main.pdf)

> [!MEMO]+ Maths Club Student Talk.
> I delivered a student talk for our maths club,aka [The Identity Club](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~maths.club/) on when stochastic systems attain equilibrium. I also wrote a blog post on this topic [here](https://theinvisiblefoe.github.io/posts/eqbm/).
