# Stuff

The page,as the name suggests is just a literal stockpile of stuff. This page contains links to some interesting stuff, to notes from my classes at IISER-K and a cornucopia of topics all unrelated to each other.

+  [Handouts](https://github.com/TheInvisibleFoe/IISER_Handouts): The professors here provide material to supplement their course. The material covers course notes to tutorials and assignments and their solutions. The institute uses WeLearn built on moodle to manage courses. There is a cli-tool that allows you to download all the files instructors have uploaded over Welearn and download it locally. So during the semester I run welearn-bot to download the handouts.

+ [QEDCAT](https://www.qedcat.com/measuretheory/index.html): This is pretty good Measure theory lecture series by Marty Ross as part of the AMSI Summer School. The lecture videos are quite low res, the reason to that is emphatically posted on his website. The handouts are quite good. Sheldon Axler's book on Meaure Theory is also pretty good: [MIRA](https://measure.axler.net/MIRA.pdf).

<!-- + Notes: There are handwritten and typed up notes written up my me and my fellow classmates -->
