I am Sabarno Saha, a student at IISER-Kolkata studying anything and everything I like. I like Physics and Maths. When I am not studying, which 
is often, I like quizzing, watching TV Shows and watching [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan) or [Nerdstalgic](https://www.youtube.com/@Nerdstalgic) on YouTube.



I like coding sometimes. My computer runs Fedora with [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland). I used to use Arch before, but I could not handle a distro that randomly breaks on my laptop when I try to do actual work(which is not often). I spend quite a lot of my free time watching TV series(please watch [Fleabag](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5687612/), itâ€™s amazing). Currently, I am watching [Only Murders in the Building](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11691774/).

I use nvim as my text editor, mostly for writing [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/)  or [typst](https://typst.app/)(a very good LaTeX alternative with markdown like syntax). 

I like listening to music, sometimes a bit too much. Here's my [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/Sab2004). I like listening to all music I find good, mostly rock. I am a big Anand Bhaskar Collective fan. If you want to listen to some hindi rock, here are some album recos :)
