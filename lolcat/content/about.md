I am Sabarno Saha, a student at IISER-Kolkata studying anything and everything I like. I like Physics and Maths. When I am not studying, which 
is often, I like quizzing, watching TV Shows and watching random game dev videos on YouTube.

I like coding sometimes. My computer runs Arch Linux with Hyprland. I use nvim as my text editor, mostly for writing LaTex stuff. 

I like listening to music, sometimes a bit too much. Here's my [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/Sab2004)
