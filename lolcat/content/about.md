I am Sabarno Saha, a student at IISER-Kolkata studying anything and everything I like. I like Physics and Maths. When I am not studying, which 
is often, I like quizzing, watching TV Shows and watching [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan) or [Nerdstalgic](https://www.youtube.com/@Nerdstalgic) on YouTube.

I like coding sometimes. My computer runs Fedora with Hyprland. I used to use [Arch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0) before, but I could not handle a distro that randomly breaks on my laptop when I try to do actual work, and then I have to try to fix for multiple hours where you go through a ton of forums and finally, when nothing works, do a fresh install of Arch. Sorry for the rant. So I distro hopped to Fedora and might hop to another one later.
I use nvim as my text editor, mostly for writing LaTex stuff. 

I like listening to music, sometimes a bit too much. Here's my [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/Sab2004). I like listening to all music I find good, mostly rock. I am a big Anand Bhaskar Collective fan. If you want to listen to some hindi rock, here are some album recos :)
